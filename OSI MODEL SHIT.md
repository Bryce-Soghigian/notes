# Comprehensive Coverage of networking programming

These notes are divided into two parts. Part 1 is all about machine to machine communication, so it overs Data Link and Network Layer and applications based on those two components.



## OSI Model

The Osi model defines how data is transmitted in a network.  There are several layers in which a network communicates. This model is a standardized model the ISO has provided.



## Application Layer

Application layer is used by  applications. These network protocols are the most common protocols that software engineers interact with. Chrome with HTTP and Outlook with SMTP.  That is known about the network

## Presentation Layer

This layer is responsible for recieving information from the application layer. The application layer will communicate with some format of information like JSON or xml and the presentation layer will convert that information into binary 

This layer is also responsible for compression and is responsible for encryption.

The S part of https is done at this layer.

## Session Layer

Session layer is responsible for connections. It has some source port and some destination port. It ensures the connection and disconnection of the physical parts.

## Transport Layer

The transport layer ensures application to application delivery. Its responsible for transporting data from one place to another. the session layer can open places, then the transport layer will try to send information to places.

## Network Layer

Transport Layer ensures application to application delievery whereas network layer  is device to device delivery. We create a packet and route it through the different addresses. 

## Datalink Layer

This layer is responsible for attaching the src and dest to our packet.

## Physical Layer

Bruh i dont need to know this one its kinda useless not my problem haha it people.




## Clarifying Questions I Came Up With While studying

1. Why was HTTP popularized? What exactly is http?
2. How does The SSL Certificate Process work?
3. What exactly is a DNS bruh







## Dataframes

A dataframe is the container in which we store information. the Ethernet Type II Frame
