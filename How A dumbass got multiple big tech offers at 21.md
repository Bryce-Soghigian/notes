# How A dumbass got multiple big tech offers at 21.

I am writing this article to talk about how I went about landing multiple offers ranging from 200,000 to 280,000 in compensation at 21 without a computer science degree. Three years ago I didn't know what a for loop was.  I will talk about how since I finished all of my prep haven't failed a single interview. I want to talk about how approach is 10x more important than some natural talent. I will also talk about how improvement is an iterative process, and how to approach your job search in an iterative way. I will also talk about whats next. What do I pursue now? 

#### Disclaimer I actually like engineering so some of the things I will mention are much easier for me. Passion will carry you for miles. 

I will break this article into three major sections

1. Pre-Preparation
2. Preparation process 
3. What do I pursue now that I got the offer? 

# What are the important considerations when starting your preparation journey?

I want to talk about these principles I have found useful throughout my career for solving problems. I will go high level first then later in the article we will solve the problem of preparing for software engineering interviews. 

## Polyas Problem Solving Principles

When solving any problem in software engineering you can generalize the approach. There is this mathematician, Polya, who talks about his 4 problem solving principles. [I will link an article here on where you can learn about them](https://math.berkeley.edu/~gmelvin/polya.pdf) , but i will generalize what they are and how they can be used in every aspect of work. I use these principles to solve algorithm problems and really any engineering problem. These principles were written to solve mathematical problems but you will find they can be used in any problem solving situation. 

#### Polya's First Principle. Understanding The Problem

Before you commit your time to something, you need to understand the problem. What am I trying to achieve???? Many people in engineering will try and start preparing by jumping straight into some book or series and not really taking time to plan out how they want to approach preparation. First understand what companies you are targeting. Out of the 10+ companies you may be targeting, what part of the evaluation process overlaps? How can we generalize our learning so we can pass all interviews instead of just amazon or just facebook. What is stopping you from reaching this goal? What knowledge do you not have, that you need to solve this problem?  What exactly is our goal? What exactly are we trying to achieve?

#### Polya's Second Principle: Devise A Plan

After fully understanding the problem what can we do to solve it? "Polya mentions that there are many reasonable ways to solve problems. The skill at choosing an appropriate strategy is best learned by solving many problems. You will find choosing a strategy becomes increasingly easy with time." That also means it is most difficult at the start. Come up with a plan on how we can get these offers. If we understand that most interviews ask 3 things

1. Object Oriented Design
2. Algorithms And Data structures
3. System Design
4. Behavorial Questions

This step is defining a plan to solve a given problem and its sub problems. We need to define a high level plan and then define the subproblems and address them. What are the important concepts in each category? What can I do to teach myself that information? How do i grade myself on this information? 

#### Polya's Third Principle: Carry out our plan

After defining every aspect of given problem we now just have to implement the solution. If you get stuck during this step or struggle too much you didn't take the second principle serious enough. Another part of this step is knowing when to give up on a given plan. If it continues not to work throw it out and come up with a new plan. 

#### Polya's Fourth Principle: Reflection on your plan

Much can be gained by reflecting on the execution of your plan. I am writing this article to follow the fourth problem solving principle. I am reflecting on what was most useful to me for cracking the coding interview. You should reflect after each study session. What did you do poorly? Where did you make progress? What parts are you struggling to comprehend? Reflection time should be part of your plan. 





# Applying these principles more in depth to your approach





# Understanding the problem.

Why do you want a job in big tech? What is your purpose in software engineering? What is it you enjoy? What keeps you coming back to engineering besides money? The reason I ask this is that most people jump into prep without thinking about the goal, or without clear defined motivation. Without a clear purpose its really easy to give up when preparing. I have seen 100s of engineers who give up before reaching their dream compensation and role. And the most common reason I see is most people don't really know why they are even preparing. Its a chore for them to improve. They aren't doing it for themselves. 

Sure the outcome is important and can be life changing, but ask yourself why you find that commitment life-changing? **REFLECT ON WHAT YOU ARE LOOKING FOR IN TECH!!!** Do some research on intrinsic motivation and find why you want this. Because becoming the top 1% engineer that gets offers consistently isn't an easy process. Find other goals that overlap with this goal of getting top offers. When you reach that top 5% the people you are competing with are also working hard to get the same role you are targeting. How do you surpass these people? If you don't have a clear purpose and reason to commit to becoming the best how will you surpass your peers who do? How do you improve yourself consistently? How do you figure out what resources are the best? How do you measure improvement? 

## Why do i want to get into big tech?(I reccomend taking some time to answer this question yourself.)

I personally went into big tech because I am very ambitious and want to surround myself with people who have similar standards for themselves. I want to be around people who are also enjoy  engineering and will spend their freetime goofing off with tech. I want to start collecting wealth so I can pursue my own ambitions with a safety net. I want to have freetime to work on my own projects and not feel burned out of tech. I want to work on products with the most challenging problems. I want to work on unique solutions where I get to be creative. I want to be the engineer that builds frameworks rather than the one to leverage them. Of course money is important but  the thing is in tech there are enough jobs in the market where you get top compensation and not have to settle on the other aspects; so long as you make yourself a top canidate.(which is simple enough to learn will talk about it after)

Now the question is where can I find similar people? Different Companies have different standards of what a top canidate is how do I prepare to become a top canidate across the board?  What organizations/startups have people who value the same things I do? 

## For my target companies, what are the things I need to learn to pass the interview process for all of them?

Google, facebook, amazon, microsoft all have different criteria that they consider but interviews in tech are generally conducted in rounds. Understand what it is that they are evaluating. For some companies this information is public. Facebook will send you a list of criteria they will evaluate you against. Google values engineers who have a strong ability to solve, and communicate techincal ideas. And of course depending on the problem type the way you communicate is different. In tech there are 4 typical types of interview rounds for new grads. Learn for your target company how they grade each process https://www.metacareers.com/swe-prep-techscreen/. What enviroment will you be coding in? Will you have auto-complete? Do they expect the code to run? 



1. Object Oriented Rounds
2. Behavioral Rounds
3. Data Structures and Algorithms Rounds
4. System Design rounds



We need to come up with a solution for acing each interview round type. So lets apply the first principle to each one of these topics, then devise a plan for each.





## Problem: How do I ace data structures and algorithms rounds? 

What are the subproblems we need to solve to approach these problems? 

1. What is the grading criteria for these types of interviews
2. What academic material is covered in these interviews?
3. How do we evaluate ourselves on a given topic and go about learning that specific topic?
4.
